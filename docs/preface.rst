Expected Audience
=================

The intended audience for this book is those with a general need to understand main AWS services. While AWS certification candidates may experience the largest benefit from this content, the materials included herein may be of use to a much wider audience, especially given modern industry trends towards AWS cloud computing technologies.

There are many elements in this book that explore topics outside the typical contents of AWS certifications. For example the use of AWS python SDK can be viewed as a development-oriented task, however has specific relevance to cloud computing configuration and function, taking a very different approach than traditional CLI-based interface configuration.
